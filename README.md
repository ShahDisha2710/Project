My_First_Project
🚗 Just Launched: Car Accessories and Rental Services (CARS) Website! 🛠️

I’m excited to share a web project I recently completed using Python and Django — a full-featured platform for car rentals, accessories, and servicing!

🔧 Key Features:

💥 Accessory Sales (Alloys, LED Kits, Grilles, Sun Shades & more)

🏎️ Car Rental Services (Luxury cars like Lamborghini, Bugatti, Rolls-Royce)

🛠️ Service Packages (from Economy to Platinum)

This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
✅ Django backend development
✅ Dynamic template rendering
✅ E-commerce UI design
✅ Booking and cart functionality
